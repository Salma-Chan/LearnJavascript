# LearnJavascript Learning Journey

Welcome to my coding playground! ðŸš€ In this repository, I'm documenting my exploration and learning process with JavaScript, Native.js, and Vue.js.

## About Me

I'm Cybermulan/ Umme-Salma Chan, a dedicated learner passionate about web development. Currently focused on mastering JavaScript and diving into the intricacies of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces with Vue.js.

## Goals

- **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including variables, functions, and asynchronous programming.
- **Native.js Mastery:** Explore the power of vanilla JavaScript (Native.js) to build strong foundations before diving into frameworks.
- **Vue.js Proficiency:** Become proficient in Vue.js for developing modern, reactive web applications.

## Learning Path

- **JavaScript Basics:** Completed introductory courses covering variables, data types, loops, and functions.
- **Native.js Exploration:** Currently delving into Native.js to understand DOM manipulation, events, and asynchronous JavaScript.
- **Vue.js Development:** Planning to build small Vue.js projects to apply the learned concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Resources

Here are some resources I'm currently using:

- [JavaScript MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
- [Eloquent JavaScript Book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [Vue.js Official Documentation](https://vuejs.org/)

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome!



Let's code, learn, and grow together! If you have any resources or tips to share, I'd love to hear from you.
